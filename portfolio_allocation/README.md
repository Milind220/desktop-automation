# Portfolio Allocation Helper

Calculating the allocation of funds into different investment instruments is a fairly annoying process. This script takes in a numerical value for the funds that you wish to invest or add to a portfolio, and spits out the percentage division of money between the different stocks/ETFs.

### Usage guide

The ratio's in which you wish to distribute your money have to be set in the code (The line and variable are marked). This ratio can be percentages, or even a relative ratio (example 1:2:1).
 
The funds to calculate can be entered either as a number or even a sum of two numbers. The sum of two numbers is useful as very often you need to add money, as well as check if your portfolio is still balanced. 
In this case, enter the number in the format: 

*current value + value to be added*

This will show how the new total value of your portfolio ***should*** be allocated. You can use this information to re-balance your portfolio if needed.
